question 1 - for the first question, we were tasked with making a repeating shape in a function by using different loops to make multiple groups of shapes. 
I made a flower with pettles on it that has variable sizes, colors, and amount of pettles by changing the variables called in the loop.

question 2 - for the second question, we were tasked with making a gridded pattern of the shapes we designed using nested loops. I made a loop for repeating the shapes into a row, and then made a nested loop for the columns of the grids.

question 3 - for the third question, we were tasked with making random aspects to our gridded shapes using arrays. I made an array of colors and an array of numbers for sizes, and made different parts of the shapes to be different sizes and colors from those arrays.
